The users needs were interpreted and implemented into the program from inquiring about the ease of use and what could be improved upon, from this the creation of user stories helped by bringing these responses down to a simple understanding of exactly what features and components are needed to be implemented.
I approach developing programs by first getting a proper undersatnding of what the end goal of the client is and getting a general scope of the work that needs to be done and getting feedback from the team regarding the prioritization of these tasks as well as potential roadblocks that could arise through the development. In my future development work I intend on implementing sprint reviews as its important to get an understanding of what was done well and what could be improved upon in future endeavors.
In software development to be a good team member you must be able to communicate effectively and have a proper understanding of the team and the roles they have. Having this understanding, it makes it significantly easier to understand what approach should be taken moving forward with the development and encourages working with the team to accomplish the deadlines and goals set throughout.
